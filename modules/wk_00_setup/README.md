##  Account Setup

### Alpine:

See the subsequent sections on that page for CSU-specific instructions on how to log in, particularly using [Open OnDemand](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_ondemand/index.html).

If needed, here is an additional [User guide](https://www.research.colostate.edu/rit/research-computing-cyberinfrastructure/get-started-with-alpine/).

### GitHub:

Use your CSU email address. After obtaining your GitHub account and installing all other software, sign up for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/). It may take several days for your application to be processed, particularly at the start of a semester.
